![image](https://github.com/OperationNorthwoods/lightanddarknewtab/blob/master/lightanddarknewtab_github_screen_ani.gif)
A minimalistic grey and white new tab page for Google Chrome. Changes automatically based on device theme. No external network requests. No analytics. No tracking. No bullshit.

### What?
1. A minimalistic new tab page replacement for Chrome.
1. New tab page fades in; color matches your device; easy on your eyes no matter the time of day.

### Why?
1. Default Chrome new tab page makes network requests and show thumbnail images of previously visited sites
Some new tab page extensions can be slow to launch if system is low on resources
1. I don't want distractions
1. I like simplicity
1. I want my new tab page to match my devie's current theme

### About
Lucas is a novice developer. After recently getting into light mode, he grew frustrated the grey color of "Dark New Tab". So he forked DannyDanny's [original](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-new-tab/mnjmegebbljjhpljjfjmkhgmokpmdbpo?hl=en-US&gl=US) Dark New Tab extension and added a light mode.
